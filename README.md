# Random-Number-Guess
A simple game developed in python as part of our fifth semester open source experiment. 
In this game, the computer generates and stores a random number from 1 to 100.
The player/user has to guess the number. If the guessed number is less than the stored number, the "Less" will be displayed. Similarly, if the number guessed by user is greater than the stored number, the "High" will be displayed.
On guessing the correct number which is stored in the variable, the player wins and the game ends.
